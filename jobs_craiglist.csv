We’re looking for a midlevel embedded software engineer to join our team.  We code most often in C but will use whatever it takes to get the job done. Our midlevel engineers can plan out their work and drive it to completion. They’ve also seen a good swath of the product development lifecycle, including prototyping, working on production code, and some exposure to mass production.  

Why should you join us?

My name is Mike, and I’ve been on our team for over 10 years. As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how I know there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.  

Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working here is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Our engineers are not just versatile within their own field’s firmware engineers work with everything from 8bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones we also have EEs driving SolidWorks, MEs developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCBs. You’ll iterate through many careers worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.  

Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. Were constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.  

Day-to-day, we work in close knit teams of typically 2 to 6 engineers. Here are the types of things our firmware team get excited about.  

•	Programming on 3 different microcontrollers and getting them all to talk together. Wirelessly.  
•	Figuring out the magic in it sequence to harness an OLED display that you harvested from a smartphone.  
•	Convincing embedded Linux to boot on a board that a coworker designed from scratch.  
•	Getting an LED to blink juuuust right.  
•	Sleeping soundly because you’re just as proud of your test suite as you are of the code its bulletproofing.  

We still operate like a small company within Accenture. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.  
We are located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at an epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. Our team enjoys working together, and we greatly value maintaining an awesome company environment. We look for people who are bright, enthusiastic, and fun We regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the Exploratorium. If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you.

WHERE will you live:  San Francisco, CA

APPLY:  www.accenture.com/careers      Embedded Software Engineer 00643552

 
BASIC QUALIFICATIONS
•	At least 2 years of experience working with code for embedded systems including coding in C

This role is designed for you if you're a top software engineer that's interested in learning how network effects work, & getting a front row seat to how high-caliber investors make decisions. You will build things from day one that make a difference in how all Founders are funded and supported. We're looking for a technical thought leader. 

In this role, on any given day you will: 

1. Build. You will own product development from idea to ship. You will work across our technologies, whether it be scaling how we handle exponentially growing data sets of the Signal founder-VC network, researching and implementing latest ML/AI technologies into our VC AI, or developing a MVP of a new product to test. 

2. Learn. You will be a student of network effects (nfx). Very few understand how they actually work, and in this role, you  you’ll have a front row seat into nfx, and will also gain a deep understanding of the relationship dynamics; nuances of the founder/VC ecosystem. You will work alongside founders and VCs, attend pitch and partner meetings, and collaborate with our team of entrepreneurs and operators. 

3. Impact. You will be transforming a largely analog industry into one that is more efficient and effective, powered by software you create. 

Who you are:  

An engineer who has been coding professionally for 4+ years, prefers full-stack development and takes the pragmatic approach to software engineering. This is not a role for engineers who prefer just backend, frontend, or are dogmatic about using specific language, frameworks, and tools. Our stack is GraphQL/Apollo, React, Ruby/Rails, Redux.

You want to be 100% immersed in tackling these challenging human problems with code, and you want to play an active role in determining product direction.This is not a role for engineers who want to code to spec.

You’re looking for a full-time job in San Francisco with competitive comp, full benefits, and a small close-knit team of passionate colleagues changing how founders are funded and supported. This is not a side hustle.

To introduce yourself, click here: https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/nfxcom/view/P_AAAAAAHAAAyN7n_ebnbH_9?trackingTag=craigslist

We are NFX, a venture fund based in San Francisco’s SOMA/Financial District (close to Montgomery BART).  We’re founded by four entrepreneurs who’ve started 10 technology companies that exited for over $10 billion. Now we’re building the venture firm we wish existed when we were running startups. A firm that runs like a software  company. 

We’ve invested in 230+ companies with network effects built into their DNA including Lyft, TRLA, Houzz, Poshmark, and Coinbase.

We did this in part by becoming students of, and mastering network effects, which account for 70% of the value of creation in tech, and we’ve been engineering them into software from day one. Now we’re using this playbook again. Today as investors, we believe software will transform the venture capital industry and create a network effect VC model.

Venture capital is a “people business”, but we’re certain that software will radically change how innovation is funded and supported in the next 10 years. There is a huge opportunity for you to build software to help founders   gain their competitive edge with fundraising, hiring, and knowledge transfer, and by opening many of our tools to the entire tech community, we’re  making an impact that is global.
